Developing a backend system for a Book Library Management project using Node.js and Express.js offers a focused approach on server-side functionalities, database operations, authentication, and file management. This project aims to facilitate the management of books, user interactions, and administrative tasks within a library context.

### **Technical Stack**

- **Backend Framework:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT for handling user authentication
- **File Storage:** Multer for file uploads, storing and serving book covers and digital documents

### **Core Backend Features**

### 1. **User Authentication and Authorization**

- Implement secure user registration and login functionality using
- Hash user passwords before storing them in the database for security.
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for managing user sessions and protecting routes.

### 2. **Database Schema Design**

- **User Model:** Includes fields such as name, email, encrypted password, and role (e.g., admin, librarian, member).
- **Book Model:** Contains book details like title, authors, ISBN, publication date, genre, cover image URL, and availability status.
- **Borrow Record Model:** Tracks book loans, associating a user with a book, checkout date, and due date.

### 3. **Book Management**

- CRUD operations for managing book records. Only authorized roles (admins/librarians) can add, update, or remove books.
- Implement search and filtering capabilities to find books by title, author, or availability.

### 4. **File Handling for Book Covers and Documents**

- Use Multer for handling the upload of book cover images and any associated digital documents (e.g., PDFs of books if available).
- use uploads directory for the storage of these files.

### 5. **User Loan Management**

- Allow members to check out and return books, automatically updating the book's availability status.
- Implement a system to track due dates and send notifications for overdue books.(optional)



### 6. **Security Measures**

- Apply JWT and role-based access control to secure endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive operations.
























### **User Authentication and Authorization**

- Implement secure user registration and login functionality using
- Hash user passwords before storing them in the database for security.
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for managing user sessions and protecting routes.



Securing the book library system with authentication and authorization mechanisms is a critical aspect. This ensures data privacy and restricted access to sensitive information.

Authentication Configuration

Setting up the process for identifying and validating users based on credentials.

Authorization Rules

Defining access control rules to restrict user actions based on roles and permissions.

Session Management

Managing user sessions securely to monitor and control user access to the syste
